In the dynamic landscape of the automotive industry, the imperative to equip vehicles with flexible hardware and upgradable software is a key priority, both in terms of efficiency and ensuring the safety of the vehicle itself.

Cloud technology addresses these needs by providing virtually unlimited resources to ensure reliability and security through cost-effective pay-per-use services for companies.

The work of this project, carried out in collaboration with the company Storm Reply, is dedicated to the implementation of a platform focused on the Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) paradigm, leveraging the comprehensive services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and aiming to create a convergence point between the edge device and the cloud environment, ensuring an advanced and secure experience for the end user.

A Software Defined Vehicle is characterised as a vehicle that primarily or entirely manages its operations, incorporates additional functionality and enables new features through software. The concept is based on the synergistic use of cloud technology for server-side operations such as updates, coupled with general-purpose hardware for vehicle-side functions. This technological integration significantly enhances vehicle security from multiple perspectives, including Human Safety Critical Security and Intrinsic Software Security.

The thesis starts with an introduction on the objectives of the project and goes on to provide a broad overview of the state of the art methodologies currently used in the cloud space, specifically related to the automotive industry.

Secondly, the entire stack for the development, maintenance and deployment of software for connected vehicles is examined in detail, along with techniques for secure communication between the vehicle and the cloud.

Finally, a real-world project is examined, in which a sample infrastructure for maintaining and deploying code, as well as analysing data from the simulated vehicle, was created using AWS Cloud Services.

%The results of this project provide a complete illustration of a Software Defined Vehicle Platform (SDVP), highlighting the successful integration of flexible hardware, extensible software, and secure cloud-based services. This reframing emphasises the evolving landscape of SDV technology and aligns with current trends and priorities within the automotive sector.

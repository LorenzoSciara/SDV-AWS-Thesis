\chapter{Cloud Computing and Amazon Web Services} \label{ch:CloudComputingAndAmazonWebServices}

As the analysis in previous chapters has shown, the Software Defined Vehicle is a pivotal advancement in the evolution of the entire automotive industry toward a safer, more efficient, and more sustainable future. Cloud computing is a crucial resource for SDV development due to its facilitation of development through its features and benefits. In the following section, cloud computing technologies will be analyzed in detail, focusing on one of the most important providers, Amazon Web Services.
\section{Cloud Computing}
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides the most comprehensive definition of cloud computing: "Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models" \cite{NISTCloudComputing}. This allows for a thorough analysis of the features of cloud computing in relation to AWS services, starting with the five essential characteristics.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{On-demand self-service:} Consumers can access and allocate computing resources autonomously, such as server time and network storage, without direct involvement with service providers. AWS offers a vast cloud infrastructure with over 200 fully-featured services that consumers can easily access and use from their AWS account.
    \item \textbf{Broad network access:} Resources can be accessed over the network through standard mechanisms, making them usable across various client platforms. In AWS services, this is translated as an on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
    \item \textbf{Resource pooling:} Providers pool computing resources in a multi-tenant model, dynamically assigning them based on consumer demand. As said before AWS services are allocable e pagabili in base alle necessit√† del momento. The customer has limited control over the exact resource location but can specify a higher-level abstraction as country, state, or datacenter. In AWS, clients can select the geographic location of their services through regions. AWS Regions provide access to AWS services that are physically located in a specific geographic area. AWS provides the option to view the availability of a particular service in a specific region, in addition to selecting different regions \cite{AWSRegions}. Resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth. It also provides services for the Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes, and analytics.
    \item \textbf{Rapid elasticity:} Resources can be easily adjusted to match fluctuations in demand, either automatically or manually. AWS provides various automated resource allocation systems, including the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) framework, which will be discussed later. The available capabilities are perceived as virtually limitless, and consumers can acquire them in any quantity at any time, always with a pay-per-use system.
    \item \textbf{Measured service:} Cloud systems efficiently manage resources through automated control and optimization, utilizing metering capabilities tailored to specific services such as storage, processing, bandwidth, and user accounts. For instance, AWS has infrastructure worldwide, allowing for easy deployment of applications in multiple physical locations. The proximity to end-users reduces latency and enhances their experience. This feature allows for clear and objective monitoring, control, and reporting of resource usage by both providers and consumers.
\end{itemize}

The three primary types of cloud computing are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These options provide different levels of control, flexibility, and management, allowing users to configure services to meet their specific requirements.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): } Consumers are able to utilize and deploy fundamental computing resources, including processing, storage, and networks. However, they only have control over operating systems, storage, and applications, as the cloud infrastructure is managed by the provider. Consumer control over some networking components is limited. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides a high level of flexibility and management control over IT resources. It is similar in practice to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are already familiar with. 
    \item \textbf{Platform as a Service (PaaS): } Consumers can deploy their applications on the cloud infrastructure using the programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The provider manages the underlying cloud infrastructure, including network, servers, operating systems, and storage, while consumers maintain control over their applications and configuration settings. This approach improves efficiency by eliminating the need to manage resource procurement, capacity allocation, software maintenance, patching, or any other tasks involved in running your application. 
    \item \textbf{Software as a Service (SaaS): } Consumers can use the provider's applications on the cloud infrastructure, which are accessible from different client devices through interfaces such as web browsers or programs. However, consumers do not have control over the underlying cloud infrastructure, including the network, servers, operating systems, and storage, except for limited user-specific application configuration settings. With a SaaS offering, users do not need to worry about maintaining the service or managing the underlying infrastructure. The focus should be on how to use the software effectively.
\end{itemize}

The analysis thus far has focused on cloud computing, specifically the essential characteristics that a cloud service must possess to be considered a true cloud service, as well as the service models that can be offered. Now, let's analyze in more detail the part related to cloud computing service deployment models and explore which models are most suitable for which workloads using AWS \cite{AWSPrivatePublicHybrid}. Note that in this case, there are slight differences between the NIST and AWS definitions of the various deployment modes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{public cloud: } According to NIST, a public cloud is defined as cloud infrastructure that is publicly accessible and owned, managed, and operated by businesses, academic institutions, government entities, or a combination thereof. In contrast, AWS defines a public cloud as infrastructure and services that are accessible over the public internet and hosted in a specific AWS Region.
    \item \textbf{private cloud: } Both NIST and AWS define private cloud as a cloud infrastructure exclusively provisioned for a single organization, which may own, manage, and operate it independently or in collaboration with a third party. However, there is a difference in the location of the infrastructure. According to NIST, the infrastructure can be located on or off premises, while in AWS documentation, the infrastructure is provisioned on premises using a virtualization layer.
    \item \textbf{hybrid cloud: } The hybrid cloud is a combination of two or more separate cloud infrastructures, private or public, connected by technology to facilitate data and application portability. It allows organizations to leverage the cloud for its efficiency and cost savings while also maintaining on-site security, privacy, and control.
\end{itemize}

Exploring the many benefits of cloud computing, the focus now shifts to a comprehensive analysis of the main value patterns of cloud computing, with some charts and graphs to help clarify the outlook.

When analyzing the resources required by a business, it becomes clear that satisfying demand through local services and resources often requires a monetary expenditure of resources that exceeds actual demand. This results in a wastage of resources that could be allocated more efficiently. On the other hand, the opposite situation may also occur, as shown in \ref{tab:OperatingExpenditureValueModel} within the same domain, where there is a higher demand than the available resources. The adoption of cloud computing transforms this paradigm. With AWS, you can pay only for the computing resources you consume and exclusively for the amount you utilize. This approach enables more cost-effective and streamlined resource utilization.

\end{table}

Cloud computing also reduces costs by aggregating resources needed by different companies in a transparent way to consumers. In addition to shortening the time to market and increasing earnings, cloud computing allows for access to resources anytime and anywhere, optimizing resource management with lower latency and a better experience as it is shown in ref{LocationFlexibilityValueModel}.

In conclusion, cloud computing, exemplified by platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), enables organizations to access IT resources on-demand via the Internet. This is facilitated by pay-as-you-go pricing models, which liberate organizations from the burdens of procuring, owning, and maintaining physical infrastructure. Cloud computing has a wide range of applications across industries, including the automotive sector. One of the main benefits of cloud computing is its dynamic scalability, which improves operational efficiency and reduces costs by utilizing resources more cost-effectively. This is due to the economies of scale inherent in cloud services, resulting in significantly lower variable expenses compared to self-managed infrastructure \cite{AWSWhatIsCloudComputing}. The characteristics of Amazon Web Services are analyzed in depth below.

\section{Amazon Web Services}

The AWS Partner Network (APN) solidifies this network with thousands of system integrators and independent software vendors who adapt their technology to work on AWS.

AWS demonstrates its commitment to innovation through continuous technological advancements. In 2014, AWS launched AWS Lambda, which pioneered serverless computing. This allows developers to run their code without the need to provision or manage servers. Another example is Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed machine learning service that empowers developers to use machine learning without any previous experience.

Rooted in more than 17 years of operational experience, AWS offers unmatched reliability, security, and performance \cite{WhatIsAWS}. Since its establishment in 2006, AWS has become a globally trusted platform, revolutionizing IT infrastructure services by providing a highly reliable, scalable, and cost-effective cloud solution for businesses worldwide in the form of web services with pay-as-you-go pricing \cite{AboutAWS}. One of the main advantages of cloud computing is the ability to replace a company's initial capital expenditures required for infrastructure with low costs that vary as needed and can scale with the business. AWS places great emphasis on the security of its systems and services, which is a fundamental pillar of their platform. In this thesis, we will analyze this feature in more detail.

\subsection{Security}
AWS is known for its flexible and secure cloud computing environment, designed to meet the strict security requirements of military, global banks, and high-sensitivity organizations.The infrastructure includes over 300 security, compliance, and governance services, supporting 143 security standards and compliance certifications. This architecture ensures scalability, reliability, and rapid deployment of applications and data while adhering to the highest security standards. Strong security at the core of an organization enables digital transformation and innovation. AWS utilizes redundant controls, continuous testing, and automation to maintain 24x7 monitoring and protection. Unlike customers' IT departments, which often operate on limited budgets, AWS prioritizes security as a core business aspect and allocates significant resources to safeguard the cloud and assist customers in ensuring robust cloud security. \cite{AWSCloudComputing}. 

AWS empowers customers to confidently advance their businesses by providing a secure and innovative cloud infrastructure, a comprehensive suite of security services, and strategic partnerships. The AWS cloud infrastructure, combined with a comprehensive suite of security services and strategic partnerships, provides a solid foundation for secure innovation.

These expert-built capabilities equip organizations with the tools they need to stay secure and compliant \cite{AWSSecurity}.

The AWS global infrastructure follows rigorous security best practices and compliance standards, ensuring that users have access to one of the most secure computing environments in the world. It is designed and managed in alignment with a range of IT security standards, providing assurance to customers, including those in the life sciences industry, that their web architectures are built on exceptionally secure computing infrastructure. The main security standards obtained from infrastructure will now be explored through AWS documentation \cite{AWSCertificationsAndAttestations}. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SOC 1, 2, 3: }AWS System and Organization Controls (SOC) Reports are third-party examination reports that demonstrate AWS's alignment with key compliance controls and objectives. SOC 1 focuses on controls relevant to a financial audit, covering security organization, access, data handling, change management, and more. SOC 2 expands to AICPA Trust Services Principles, evaluating controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. The SOC 3 report is a publicly available summary of SOC 2. It includes an external auditor's assessment, AWS management's assertion, and an overview of AWS Infrastructure and Services. The report provides transparency and demonstrates AWS's commitment to security, compliance, and protection of customer data \cite{AWSSOC3}.

    \item \textbf{FedRAMP:} FedRAMP is a US government program that ensures a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. It is aligned with NIST SP 800 series. The program mandates that cloud service providers undergo an independent security assessment by a third-party assessment organization (3PAO) to verify compliance with the  Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) \cite{Fedramp}.
    \item \textbf{ISO 9001:} "ISO 9001 is a globally recognized standard for quality management. It helps organizations of all sizes and sectors to improve their performance, meet customer expectations and demonstrate their commitment to quality. Its requirements define how to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve a quality management system (QMS)" \cite{ISO9001}. AWS ISO 9001:2015 certification directly supports customers developing, migrating, and operating their quality-controlled IT systems in the AWS cloud. They can use AWS compliance reports as evidence for their own ISO 9001:2015 programs and industry-specific quality programs \cite{AWSISO9001}.
    \item \textbf{ISO/IEC 27001:} ISO/IEC 27001 is a global security standard that outlines requirements for the systematic management of corporate and customer information. AWS has achieved ISO 27001 certification, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to assessing, managing, and mitigating information security risks. The certification covers AWS infrastructure, data centers, and services, ensuring ongoing compliance with international security standards \cite{ISOIEC27001}.
    \item \textbf{ISO/IEC 27017:} "ISO/IEC 27017:2015 gives guidelines for information security controls applicable to the provision and use of cloud services by providing: additional implementation guidance for relevant controls specified in ISO/IEC 27002; additional controls with implementation guidance that specifically relate to cloud services. This Recommendation | International Standard provides controls and implementation guidance for both cloud service providers and cloud service customers" \cite{ISOIEC27017}. This certification ensures the implementation of precise, cloud-specific controls and validates AWS commitment to robust security measures in cloud services \cite{AWSISOIEC27017}.
    \item \textbf{ISO/IEC 27018:} ISO 27018 is a global code of practice for safeguarding personal data in the cloud. It builds upon ISO 27002 and offers guidance on implementing controls for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in public clouds. AWS's ISO 27018 certification affirms its dedication to internationally recognized standards, emphasizing privacy and content protection \cite{AWSISOIEC27018}.
    \item \textbf{HITRUST:} The Health Information Trust Alliance Common Security Framework (HITRUST CSF) integrates global standards such as GDPR, ISO, NIST, PCI, and HIPAA to establish a comprehensive framework for security and privacy controls. Some AWS services have been assessed under the HITRUST CSF Assurance Program by an approved HITRUST CSF Assessor and have been found to meet the HITRUST CSF Certification Criteria.  Customers can inherit AWS certification for controls relevant to their cloud architectures established under the HITRUST Shared Responsibility Matrix (SRM). The certification is valid for two years, describes the AWS services that have been validated, and can be publicly accessed \cite{AWSHITRUSTCSF}.
    \item \textbf{STAR:} The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) introduced the Security, Trust, and Assurance Registry (STAR) to promote transparency in cloud provider security practices. STAR is a publicly accessible registry that documents the security controls of cloud computing offerings. AWS has joined the CSA STAR Self-Assessment, aligning with CSA best practices.

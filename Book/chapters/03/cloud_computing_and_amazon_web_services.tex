\chapter{Cloud Computing and Amazon Web Services} \label{ch:CloudComputingAndAmazonWebServices}

As the analysis in previous chapters has shown, the \gls{ac:sdv} is a pivotal advancement in the evolution of the entire automotive industry toward a safer, more efficient, and more sustainable future. Cloud computing is a crucial resource for \gls{ac:sdv} development due to its facilitation of development through its features and benefits. In the following section, cloud computing technologies will be analyzed in detail, focusing on one of the most important providers, \gls{ac:aws}.
\section{Cloud Computing}
The \gls{ac:nist} provides the most comprehensive definition of cloud computing such as: "a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models" \cite{NISTCloudComputing}. This allows for a thorough analysis of the features of cloud computing in relation to \gls{ac:aws} services, starting with the five essential characteristics.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{On-demand self-service:} Consumers can access and allocate computing resources autonomously, such as server time and network storage, without direct involvement with service providers. \gls{ac:aws} offers a vast cloud infrastructure with over 200 fully-featured services that consumers can easily access and use from their \gls{ac:aws} account.
    \item \textbf{Broad network access:} Resources can be accessed over the network through standard mechanisms, making them usable across various client platforms. In \gls{ac:aws} services, this is translated as an on-demand delivery of \gls{ac:it} resources over the \textit{Internet} with "pay-as-you-go" pricing. 
    \item \textbf{Resource pooling:} Providers pool computing resources in a multi-tenant model, dynamically assigning them based on consumer demand. As said before \gls{ac:aws} services are allocable e pagabili in base alle necessit√† del momento. The customer has limited control over the exact resource location but can specify a higher-level abstraction as country, state, or datacenter. In \gls{ac:aws}, clients can select the geographic location of their services through regions. textit{\gls{ac:aws} Regions} provide access to \gls{ac:aws} services that are physically located in a specific geographic area. \gls{ac:aws} provides the option to view the availability of a particular service in a specific region, in addition to selecting different regions \cite{AWSRegions}. Resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth. It also provides services for the \gls{ac:iot}, machine learning, data lakes, and analytics.
    \item \textbf{Rapid elasticity:} Resources can be easily adjusted to match fluctuations in demand, either automatically or manually. \gls{ac:aws} provides various automated resource allocation systems, including the \gls{ac:aws} \gls{ac:cdk} framework, which will be discussed later. The available capabilities are perceived as virtually limitless, and consumers can acquire them in any quantity at any time, always with a "pay-per-use" system.
    \item \textbf{Measured service:} Cloud systems efficiently manage resources through automated control and optimization, utilizing metering capabilities tailored to specific services such as storage, processing, bandwidth, and user accounts. For instance, \gls{ac:aws} has infrastructure worldwide, allowing for easy deployment of applications in multiple physical locations. The proximity to end-users reduces latency and enhances their experience. This feature allows for clear and objective monitoring, control, and reporting of resource usage by both providers and consumers.
\end{itemize}

The three primary types of cloud computing are \gls{ac:iaas},\gls{ac:paas}, and \gls{ac:saas}. These options provide different levels of control, flexibility, and management, allowing users to configure services to meet their specific requirements.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\gls{ac:iaas}:} Consumers are able to utilize and deploy fundamental computing resources, including processing, storage, and networks. However, they only have control over operating systems, storage, and applications, as the cloud infrastructure is managed by the provider. Consumer control over some networking components is limited. \gls{ac:iaas} provides a high level of flexibility and management control over \gls{ac:it} resources. It is similar in practice to existing \gls{ac:it} resources that many \gls{ac:it} departments and developers are already familiar with. 
    \item \textbf{\gls{ac:paas}:} Consumers can deploy their applications on the cloud infrastructure using the programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The provider manages the underlying cloud infrastructure, including network, servers, operating systems, and storage, while consumers maintain control over their applications and configuration settings. This approach improves efficiency by eliminating the need to manage resource procurement, capacity allocation, software maintenance, patching, or any other tasks involved in running your application. 
    \item \textbf{\gls{ac:saas}:} Consumers can use the provider's applications on the cloud infrastructure, which are accessible from different client devices through interfaces such as web browsers or programs. However, consumers do not have control over the underlying cloud infrastructure, including the network, servers, operating systems, and storage, except for limited user-specific application configuration settings. With a \gls{ac:saas} offering, users do not need to worry about maintaining the service or managing the underlying infrastructure. The focus should be on how to use the software effectively.
\end{itemize}

The analysis thus far has focused on cloud computing, specifically the essential characteristics that a cloud service must possess to be considered a true cloud service, as well as the service models that can be offered. Now, let's analyze in more detail the part related to cloud computing service deployment models and explore which models are most suitable for which workloads using \gls{ac:aws} \cite{AWSPrivatePublicHybrid}. Note that in this case, there are slight differences between the \gls{ac:nist} and \gls{ac:aws} definitions of the various deployment modes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{public cloud:} According to \gls{ac:nist}, a public cloud is defined as cloud infrastructure that is publicly accessible and owned, managed, and operated by businesses, academic institutions, government entities, or a combination thereof. In contrast, \gls{ac:aws} defines a public cloud as infrastructure and services that are accessible over the public internet and hosted in a specific \textit{\gls{ac:aws} Region}.
    \item \textbf{private cloud:} Both \gls{ac:nist} and \gls{ac:aws} define private cloud as a cloud infrastructure exclusively provisioned for a single organization, which may own, manage, and operate it independently or in collaboration with a third party. However, there is a difference in the location of the infrastructure. According to \gls{ac:nist}, the infrastructure can be located on or off premises, while in \gls{ac:aws} documentation, the infrastructure is provisioned on premises using a virtualization layer.
    \item \textbf{hybrid cloud:} The hybrid cloud is a combination of two or more separate cloud infrastructures, private or public, connected by technology to facilitate data and application portability. It allows organizations to leverage the cloud for its efficiency and cost savings while also maintaining on-site security, privacy, and control.
\end{itemize}

Exploring the many benefits of cloud computing, the focus now shifts to a comprehensive analysis of the main value patterns of cloud computing, with some charts and graphs to help clarify the outlook.

\end{table}

Cloud computing reduces costs by aggregating resources needed by different companies in a transparent way to consumers. This means that a company will no longer need to spend excessive amounts of money on building its \gls{ac:it} system to meet overestimated demands or satisfy underestimations of necessary resources as it is shown in \ref{tab:OperatingExpenditureValueModel}.
In addition to shortening the time to market and increasing earnings, cloud computing allows for access to resources anytime and anywhere, optimizing resource management with lower latency and a better experience as it is shown in \ref{tab:LocationFlexibilityValueModel}.

In conclusion, cloud computing, exemplified by platforms like \gls{ac:aws}, enables organizations to access \gls{ac:it} resources on-demand via the Internet. This is facilitated by pay-as-you-go pricing models, which liberate organizations from the burdens of procuring, owning, and maintaining physical infrastructure. Cloud computing has a wide range of applications across industries, including the automotive sector. One of the main benefits of cloud computing is its dynamic scalability, which improves operational efficiency and reduces costs by utilizing resources more cost-effectively. This is due to the economies of scale inherent in cloud services, resulting in significantly lower variable expenses compared to self-managed infrastructure \cite{AWSWhatIsCloudComputing}. The characteristics of \gls{ac:aws} are analyzed in depth below.
